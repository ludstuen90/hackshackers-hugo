 will need pages_read_engagement permission to be able to see public data of the page, including events. 


we are making it to load the calendar. but for some reason it is not parsing correctly the data. it says there is a null value in trying to parse indexOf. inside of ical file.

maybe that means my ical is badly formed. it probably does.
